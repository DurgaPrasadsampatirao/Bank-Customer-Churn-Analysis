## About Bank Churn
Bank churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using the services of a bank. It is a critical issue as it affects the bankâ€™s revenue and growth.

Common reasons for churn include poor customer service, high fees, and better offers from competitors. Banks use churn analysis to identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies. Reducing churn is essential for maintaining a stable customer base.

In this analysis, we will explore various factors influencing bank churn. This includes examining customer demographics, account activities, and service usage patterns. By understanding these factors, we aim to identify key drivers of churn and develop effective retention strategies.

# Recommendations
### Focus on Active Membership: 
Since there is a significant difference between being an active member and churn, incentivize customers to remain active. Implement loyalty programs, personalized offers, and engagement activities to keep members active.

### Improve Services in Certain Geographies: 
Geography has a significant impact on churn. Identify regions with higher churn rates and analyze local factors affecting customer satisfaction. Tailor services and marketing strategies to address specific regional needs.

### Optimize Product Offerings: 
The number of products a customer holds significantly impacts churn. Encourage customers to use more products by bundling services, offering discounts for multiple products, and providing educational resources on product benefits.

### Address Customer Complaints: 
A significant relationship between complaints and churn suggests the need for better customer service. Enhance complaint resolution processes, reduce response times, and actively seek feedback to improve customer satisfaction.

### Target High-Risk Age Groups: 
Age is a significant factor in churn. Identify age groups that are more likely to churn and develop targeted retention strategies, such as tailored communication, age-specific promotions, and personalized services.

### Monitor Credit Scores: 
Since there is a significant difference in credit scores between exited and non-exited customers, consider credit score trends in your risk assessment models and offer financial advice or assistance to customers with lower credit scores.

### Manage Account Balances: 
Balance differences significantly affect churn. Help customers manage their balances better by offering financial planning tools, budget management advice, and incentives for maintaining healthy balances.

### Evaluate and Enhance Satisfaction Scores: 
Though there is no significant difference between satisfaction score and churn in general, satisfaction score still plays a crucial role in overall customer satisfaction. Continually evaluate and improve factors contributing to customer satisfaction.

### Review Card Types Offered:
Although there is no significant difference between card types and churn, ensure that the card offerings align with customer needs and preferences. Consider adding features or benefits that enhance the value of your card products.

### Analyze Estimated Salary and Point Earned: 
No significant differences were found here, but continue to monitor these metrics to ensure they do not become significant factors in the future. Adjust marketing strategies and rewards programs as necessary to align with customer income and point-earning potential.

### Correlation Between Satisfaction Score and Complaints:
